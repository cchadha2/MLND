    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

If the data is not linearly separable in this case, the use of   polynomial or rbf kernels can create more complex boundary shapes in higher dimensions which can be projected back down to the original dimension space of the problem, thus classifying the points well. However, it should be noted that the error function for SVM includes a regularization parameter that penalises the complexity of the model and since we have one-hot encoded the data to create a total of 103 features, SVM may not be the ideal model to fit. If, instead, we use a linear kernel and set the C parameter to a high enough value such that the algorithm focuses on minimising the margin error, we can mitigate this issue.

    "AdaBoost (using a decision tree model) is the most appropriate of the three models. Looking at the F-score on the testing set, AdaBoost outperforms the other models on each of the training set sizes and obtains the highest F-score when 100% of the training data is used. Although it is not the best model in terms of prediction/training time, the difference between AdaBoost and logistic regression is negligible, particularly when compared to the SVM model which greatly increased in both prediction and training time when training data is increased.\n",

    "As mentioned previously, AdaBoost is suitable for the data as it provides feature selection, which is useful for this dataset with a total of 103 features. Decision trees (or stumps in this case) will create a binary partition on the data based upon the feature that and point where the reduction in error is maximised. This is how the model provides explicit feature selection.  The decision tree model that is being boosted is also already highly suitable for this data since this is a binary classification problem but it is also being tweaked at the end of each round of boosting in favour of the instances misclassified by the previous classifier."

    "The AdaBoost model, short for Adaptive Boosting model, works by boosting other classifiers (such as decision trees or SVM). In this case, imagine we have a set of points, each being a person's salary, and we want to divide these points into two groups - under 50k and over 50k. Some of the ways we can do this are: by drawing a line (linear regression); drawing a more complex shape like a circle (SVM); or by vertically splitting the points into two groups (decision tree).\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision tree model that we are boosting in our case works by first splitting our salary data into two groups based on a certain value of one of the defining features of the population (i.e. age, education, hours worked per week, etc.). Let's say the model has first split the data based on a certain value of age. Salary points that are above this age will be classified as one group (either above 50k or equal to or below 50k) and those below this age will be classified as the other group. It can then split the data into two further groups to better its prediction. The split can occur on some feature such as the hours worked per week somewhere within one of the two groups that were earlier split by age. The model can then continue to split, based on some conditions set by the user, until it has split on a number of different features to find the two most accurate groups that make above 50k or below 50k.\n",
    "\n",
    "AdaBoost, by default, takes the above decision tree model and uses that for its first round of predictions. Any of the points in the wrong group after this first round are then given higher consideration in the next round of predictions and the model is tweaked to classify our points a little bit better. After a number of rounds, we are (hopefully!) left with a model that divides our salary points into two groups that better classify the data than if we had just used our base model on its own (i.e. linear regression, SVM, or decision tree)."

    "An important task when performing supervised learning on a dataset like the census data we study here is determining which features provide the most predictive power. By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a scikit-learn classifier (e.g., adaboost, random forests) that has a `feature_importance_` attribute, which is a function that ranks the importance of features according to the chosen classifier.  In the next python cell fit this classifier to training set and use this attribute to determine the top 5 most important features for the census dataset."

    "### Question 6 - Feature Relevance Observation\n",
    "When **Exploring the Data**, it was shown there are thirteen available features for each individual on record in the census data. Of these thirteen records, which five features do you believe to be most important for prediction, and in what order would you rank them and why?"

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "I would rank the five most important features in order of most important to least important as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- age\n",
    "- education-num\n",
    "- capital-gain\n",
    "- capital-loss\n",
    "- hours-per-week\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Age is first as the older the person, the more likely they are to make more than 50k. Education-num was put second due to the education feature being categorical which means one-hot-encoding has split its values into a number of new features which are input into the model but they will likely not be as important to the model as education-num which contains the same information in one feature and is made up of continuous values. Capital-gain and capital-loss were included as fourth and fifth due to them also being continous features which were not split up by one-hot-encoding and thus are likely considered more important than the remaining features. An increase in capital-gain would likely put the person above 50k since they are wealthy enough to own assets that have increased in value. Similarly, a value for capital-loss, although detracting from the person's overall wealth, would still imply that the person is wealth enough to own assets as per capital-gain. Like age, as hours-per-week increase, the person is likely to make more than 50k a year but this feature is probably not as important since a young person in a low-paying job could be working a high number of hours and still not making more than 50k. \n"

Capital-gain and capital-loss are given the same weight as, from my intuition, a value in either column implies the person is wealthy enough to have assets which are appreciating or depreciating, meaning they probably make more than 50k. Hours-per-week is ranked lower than the aforementioned features but is still important. However, education-num is given a lower importance than the other features which I find suprising since I assumed that a higher education-num was likely one of the strongest predictors of a person making more than 50k a year.\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

In that question, the optimised model took a large amount of time to train and predict from the full data compared to the unoptimised model. Although in that case, we saw an increase in accuracy and F-score due to optimisation, it would be interesting to also see how the results differ for an unoptimised model trained on the reduced data and comparing that with the optimised model trained on the full data.  \n",
